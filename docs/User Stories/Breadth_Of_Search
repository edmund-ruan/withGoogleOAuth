The user can make the filters as broad or specific as they want, but the system will offer listings with the lowest crime rate by default. The breadth can range from a general search like “all restaurants,” to specific cuisines such as “Vietnamese,” or even commonly searched dishes such as “sushi.” Additionally, multi-transport options are also displayed so that the user can have the option to switch between trains, busses, bikes, or walking.
