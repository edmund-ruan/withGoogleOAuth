As a logged-in user, I would want to have an interface where I can compare two different rental spaces. This situation occurs when a person is undecided amongst many different living arrangements. To resolve this and hopefully give someone insight into the best possible decision, the app will have a compare feature. Since each rental space will have the attributes price, square footage, popularity (which could be measured using a star rating system), layout, furnished status, etc. we can set this up as a viewable side by side table to make picking easier.
