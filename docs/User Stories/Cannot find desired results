First, as a user, when the filter I choose cannot generate enough results(less or equal to 5 apartment recommended), I want to see some compromised results and these results will be categorized. For example, the distance limitation can be expanded 2 blocks further or more; some alternative transportation methods with a short walk within 10min walk can be showed and I can choose to add these transportation methods to filters; and the chosen rent range will be adjusted. In addition, these above results will be showed in categories, by which filter is compromised. I can also choose to combine two categories together and generate results. Thus, I can decide how to change filters or use current compromised filtered results to find desirable apartments. Moreover, having categories can let me know how certain compromised filter leads to certain kinds of results.
