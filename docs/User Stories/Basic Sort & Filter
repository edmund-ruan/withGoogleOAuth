As a logged-in user, I would want to filter through apartments by geographic location. Then, I would want the results to be sorted by one of the following metrics: number of restaurants within a 1.5 mile radius of the apartment (high to low), crime rate (low to high), and nearby public transportation availability (high to low). Only one sort method can be used at a time but multiple filters can be applied at once to narrow down results. Essentially, I should be able to sort by whatever criteria is most important to me from what the app offers. Ideally, I would be able to save apartments I like from the search results.
